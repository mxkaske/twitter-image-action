# Twitter-Image-Action

This repo updates my Twitter profile hourly.

Depending on the response of the openweathermap-API, `index.js` changes

- glasses frame randomly based on fixed colors set
- lenses depending on if the sky is cloudy or not
- background color to light or dark if the current time is between or outside sunset/-rise

in `assets/max.svg` and calls the Twitter-API to update the profile.
